Hello!
In the folder "Example Classification" you will see a small part of my hard skills. In the file "Survivors of the Titanic" you will see an example of data visualization and analysis. As well a model that can predict whether a passenger will survive or not.

Similar models can be used to predict customer behavior. For example: will he buy the product or not, will he use the program or leave it, etc.

Thank you.
